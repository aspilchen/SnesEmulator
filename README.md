The cpp folder holds my experimenting and first try at implementing the CPU for the SNES in C++. I started with that because it's a language I am familiar with, and I just wanted to get a somewhat working concept.

I then decided to move the project over to rust just to learn and practice working with rust. I plan on re-implementing the CPU and then extending the project from there. I would like to have a functional SNES emulator made entirely in rust. I may use some Python for code generation.
