SNES emulator using Rust.

Learning Rust while making a SNES emulator. The SNES folder is where I am implementing the actual emulator. I plan to make another library for UI eventually. For now the main is just there to experiment.

Figuring out how to link the Rust documentaion with the repo. That way people can skim through the docs to hopefully get a better idea of whats happening. I am new to rust, and haven't tried this before so it will take some experimenting to get it right.
