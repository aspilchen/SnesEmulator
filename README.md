SNES emulator using Rust.

The hardware library is where most of the actual SNES stuff is being implemented. I will probably make another library for the GUI eventually.

Using some python scripts in the code_generation folder to generate some of the instructions.

The main is just a placeholder for now. I will build some tests in the future.
